            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A PROPOSAL,</hi> Humbly offer'd to the Conſideration of the Honourable the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament aſſembled, for raiſing a farther Supply towards the Erecting and Maintenance of the intended College or Hoſpital at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> for Ancient and Maimed Mariners and Sea-men; Or ſuch other Good and Publick Uſe as the Honourable Houſe ſhall think fit.</head>
            <p>THAT whereas by the Conſtitution and Eſtabliſhment of, or ſome Grant to Chriſt's Hoſpital in <hi>London,</hi> the Governors thereof have Power to lett Leaſes, or diſpoſe of Carooms, or Licenſes and Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for keeping and working for Hire, Cars and Carts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within the ſaid City and the Liberties thereof, As an Inheritance or Perpetuity belonging to the ſaid Hoſpital; and no Perſon, who is not ſo qualified, can keep, or work for hire, any Car or Cart within the ſaid City or Liberties: By virtue whereof, the Number of ſuch Cars and Carts is ſetled at about 430, which is found a ſufficient and convenient Number; Whereby many great Inconveniences are avoided: There being ſufficient for all neceſſary Occaſions, and yet not ſuch an exorbitant Number as to clog up the Streets and obſtruct the Paſſages, or cauſe the Owners to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Livelihood thereby, to the ruin of themſelves and Families for want of a full Imploy: (As was the Caſe of many Hackny Coach-men, before their Number was limitted by Act of Parliament:) But on the contrary theſe Carooms, tho they coſt the Owners 100 <hi>l.</hi> a piece at the leaſt, upon taking the Leaſe, beſides Office-Fees, and ſome yearly Rent or Acknowledgment to the Hoſpital, yet are they eſteemed as valuable Chattels to be transferr'd, and as ready Money if offer'd to ſale, (according to ſuch Term and Intereſt as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor has therein) as any other Leaſes whatſoever; and many Hundreds of Families are well ſupported thereby: And the Caroom (which is a Badg of Braſs given by the Hoſpital, and born by the Car-man upon the String of his Car) denoting the Number of ſuch Car, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gives them ſuch a Reputation that they are readily intruſted with the Carriage of any Goods; there being a preſent Remedy againſt them in Caſe of any Miſdemeanor, in ſuch their Imployment.</p>
            <p>AND the City of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and Liberties thereof, and Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> (without the Liberty of the City of <hi>London</hi>) and the ſeveral Out-Pariſhes in <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> bordering upon the Liberties of the ſaid Cities, and lying within the Extent of the weekly Bills of Mortality, being of late become very Populous, and likely ſtill to Augment; And the greateſt part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom living or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein, (eſpecially during the Seſſions of Parliament;) whoſe Coaches are many times not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, but even endamaged and broken, by over-numerous and diſorderly Car-men and Carters, with their Cars and Carts, and that without any means of Reparation or Satisfaction from them; and the rather for that ſuch Car-men and Carters, as live out of the Liberty of the ſaid City of <hi>London,</hi> carry no Badg to denote their Place of abode, or where they may be found, and are without all Government and Reſtraint, as to their Number or otherwiſe; Whereby likewiſe Cheats and Frauds may the more eaſily be committed by them of the Goods with the Carriage whereof they are intruſted, <hi>And eſpecially in the Caſe of Fires:</hi> And the ill-practice of ſome brings a Diſeredit to the reſt, to the great Hinderance of ſuch there Imployment and Livelihood.</p>
            <p>AND therefore for preventing the ſeveral Inconveniences before mentioned, and raiſing ſome-what of a Supply for ſo excellent a Uſe as aforeſaid, It is humbly propoſed, That the Number of ſuch Cars and Carts to reſide and work for Hire, out of the Liberty of the ſaid City of <hi>London,</hi> and within the Extent of the weekly Bills of Mortality, be reſtrain'd to 200, (or ſuch other Number as ſhall be thought requiſite) and Licenſes granted of them from time to time for 21 Years, each to pay a Fine of 50 <hi>l.</hi> upon taking their firſt Licenſe, and ſuch yearly Rent to the Hoſpital, during the Term, as ſhall be thought reaſonable; And after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the Term, to pay ſuch farther Fine, upon taking any new Licenſe, as ſhall be agreed upon with the Commiſſioners or Truſtees to be appointed for the Management thereof, without any Abatement of the old Rent; And ſuch Commiſſioners or Truſtees to be impower'd by Act of Parliament to grant ſuch Licenſes, and make By-Laws for the well ordering and governing the Perſons ſo to be Licenſed, and to cauſe the ſame to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>AND foraſmuch as divers Brewers, Inn-keepers, Wood-mongers, Cole-mongers, and Maſters and Owners of Wharſs, living within the ſaid City and Liberties of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and Out-Pariſhes aforeſaid, keep and daily uſe divers Drays, Carts, and Carriages for carrying away their Dung, and for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying out their Beer, Ale, Coles, Wood, Timber, Stones, Lime, and other their Goods and Merchandizes (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reſpective Trades and Imployments) by whom, or their Servants, (for want of ſome good Orders and Rules of direction concerning them, and a ready way to detect and puniſh the Offenders) many Abuſes and Diſorders are frequently done and committed with ſuch their Drays, Carts and Carriages, in the Streets and Paſſages where they paſs, To the great Annoyance of divers of the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Members of Parliament, when going upon the weighty Affairs of the Nation, And to the frequent Abuſe, and even hazard of the Lives of many other of his Majeſties good Subjects, in paſſing about their Lawful Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: THAT therefore, tho it may not ſeem reaſonable to lay any Mulct upon the Perſons aforeſaid, for uſing ſuch their Drays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about their own Lawful Concerns and Imployments, Yet it may be requiſite (for preventing Diſorders and Abuſes) to ſubject them likewiſe to the Orders and Government of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners or Truſtees ſo to be Conſtituted or Appointed as aforeſaid; And to oblige the Owners or Occupiers of ſuch Drays, Carts and Carriages, to carry a Badg or Ticket upon ſome apparent Place of every ſuch Dray, Cart or Carriage, expreſſing the Name and Place of Abode of the Owner or Oecupier thereof; And to procure the ſame to be enter'd in the Office to be kept by the ſaid Commiſſioners or Truſtees for the Purpoſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, And to be renewed ſo often as ſuch Dray, Cart or Carriage, ſhall come to any new Owner or Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, or that ſuch Owner or Occupier ſhall have any new Habitation or Place of abode; They paying only a ſmall Fee for the ſame. And the Fines and Forefeitures ariſing by Offences and Miſdemeanors will be an Augmentation of the propoſed Revenue, or help to defray the neceſſary Charge of the Management thereof.</p>
